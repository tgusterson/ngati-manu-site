  Ngāti Manu Website
</h1>
This project is a website for the Ngāti Manu iwi which I made primarily using GatsbyJS, a static site generator for React. The site is used to share the iwi's history, upcoming events, handle member registration & Marae booking enquiries. There is also a companion admin portal project [admin portal project](https://github.com/tgusterson/admin.ngati-manu) for user management.
